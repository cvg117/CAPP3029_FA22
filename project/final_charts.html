    <h1>The Daily Black Diamond: Bike Transit Dangers in Chicago </h1>
    <p>
        Cities are, by definition, compact human environments. Providing services that are constrained by 
        distance traveled within them is extremely efficient. As we continue to grapple with human-driven climate change, 
        it is essential that we leverage this trait to help individuals and companies reduce their carbon 
        footprints. 
    <br>
    <br>
        To take best advantage, however, requires the means of transit to be efficient. Car centered 
        transportation systems are energy, space, and time inefficient within urban centers. 
        Furthermore, they are dangerous. In such compact living situations, valuing car convenience and access
        devalues not only environmental needs, but human safety. These safety concerns go beyond a barrier to entry for green, 
        human-centered transit methods. They create a transit environment in which the lives of non-drivers are endangered with little recourse. 
        <a href ="https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/11/29/life-and-death-in-chicagos-most-dangerous-bike-lane/">Recent
        investigations</a> into accidents on Milwaukee Avenue cited higher than average hit and run incidents for car-on-bike accidents,
        and vast underreporting/compensation by/for those struck.
    <br>
    <br>
        This series of visualizations sheds light on these dangers. Understanding the extent and location of 
        danger to cyclists and pedestrians reveals the amount of work to be done. Providing better protected 
        lanes, fewer car-legal streets, and more wraparound services for human-driven commuters can
        reduce conjoined harms to our populations and our planet.

            Addressing transit concerns begins at the where. In this case, the literal pain points are easily evident. Former Chicago Mayor
            Rahm Emanuel knew this as well as anyone when he proposed his
            <a href ="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/cdot/bike/general/ChicagoStreetsforCycling2020.pdf">
             2020 Streets for Cycling Plan</a> in 2012. The city took this effort even further with its 
            <a href = https://visionzerochicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VZ_HCC_FrameworkPlan_2018-06-15.pdf>Vision Zero Chicago</a> plan to 
            reduce high crash corridors. The outcomes? Unfortunately, failure takes many forms regarding these plans. A lack of concerted funding
            and infrastructural efforts left the city short on the vast majority of its goals. As an example, the 2012 plan promised 100 miles of
            protected bike lanes by 2015. <a href = https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/02/01/chicagos-bike-lane-efforts-have-fallen-short-for-decades-can-lightfoot-help-the-city-catch-up/>
            As of 2021,</a> there were almost 27 miles, accounting for under 10% of the total bike paths in the city.
            Beyond failing to address the most most obviously dangerous zones, these plans were largely 
            <a href =https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/us/chicago-bike-plan-accused-of-neighborhood-bias.html>absent any mention</a> of
            the South and West sides.

    <h3>Broken Spokes: Chicago's Most Dangerous Streets</h3>

        We know - and have not succeeded in addressing - the where of this issue. Another avenue to progress would be the why. What causes 
        potentially lethal encounters between cars and bicyclists? Can we reduce those causes? In large part, it is no different 
        from the causes of car-on-car accidents. Distracted and dangerous driving in a confined urban environment is a 
        recipe for collision, although, it must be noted that bike behavior regarding traffic control signals is an important contributory factor.
        Unfortunately, the general apathy towards the subject limits our understanding of even these most obvious effects. 
        For every single explained accident on Chicago's most dangerous streets there are .97 accidents with no explanation 
        provided by the reporting officer. This gap in qualitative informaton is exacerbated by massive underreporting caused by a 
        lack of positive civil outcomes for bikers, according to <a href="https://www.bikelaneuprising.com/">bike safety advocates</a>

    <h3>Hits and Headers: Comparing Accident Counts to Damage Done</h3>

        Of course, the magnitude of a problem is not the only metric to consider in how it must be dealt with.
        After all, significantly more car-on-car crashes occur throughout a year on Chicago's streets. Where the
        twinned problems diverge is in the severity of these incidents. While car-on-car crashes outnumber
         car-on-human crashes 28-1, the likelihood of serious injury in such accidents in Chicago is vanishingly small.
        The likelihood of severe injury for pedestrians and bikers is 3 to 5 times higher when struck by a vehicle.
    <br>
    <br>
        Chicago is known as a geographically large, well-blocked out, and active city. We can take better advantage of
        these qualities to become a safer, greener, healthier city in the future by refocusing our infrastructural efforts
        on non-car transit.

    <h2>Thoughts on Process</h2>
    <p>
        On a personal level, I was driven to investigate this after I joined the data recently.
        Over the summer, I was involved in an ugly hit and (attempted) run while biking on Clark Street. The confrontation 
        that followed crystallized the need to protect bikers from a car culture that sees their safety as incidental to drivers' convenience.
    <br>
    <br>
        Bike accidents are massively underreported in general, and in my case in specific. I am particularly concerned by what the map shows 
        for the south and west sides. It implies that beyond normal standards of underreporting, these areas of the city are being 
        hugely underserved and under supported for bicyclists. I would also be curious to re-do this analysis over a non-covid 
        timeframe when there would be more activity on the streets in general.
    <br>
    <br>
        I had originally hoped to compare bike safety metrics between multiple cities and involve more specific data on bike
        lane implementations between those cities. Unfortunately, the spotiness of that data and the discrepancies in its reporting
        between cities put that goal out of reach for this iteration. Changing course gave me the opportunity to apply lived
        experience and personal understanding of the situation in my home city of Chicago.
    <br>
    <br>
        The most critical details of my process surround the coding of severity. This was provided as a set of vague categorical options
        that reporting officers would fill out based on their observations and victim reports. To provide stronger analysis and increase
        its usability, I converted the four categories into a range from 0 to 1 at regular 0.25 intervals per individual report within
        an accident. As an example, an accident could be assigned a severity score of 1 for a single fatality, or for 2 individuals with 
        "reported and evident" injuries.
    <br>
    <br>
        I was most comfortable with the sociological and analytical portions of the project and had quite a bit of trouble with the code. 
        The cleaning and preparation steps were interesting and engaging as I worked through a rich, idiosyncratic dataset. 
        I was able to boil down most of what I needed without much issue. However, the geospatial and D3.js portions were significantly 
        more difficult. I typically expand my coding knowledge through a very granular bottom-up approach. Adapting to retrofit and rework 
        is a new way of thinking about coding; a new muscle to stretch and work.
    <br>
    <br>        
        Despite my coding difficulties, I was proud of my chart choices. I am primarily a verbal storyteller, so expanding my vocabulary 
        into visual storytelling was exciting, and difficult. I am particularly happy with the multiline chart as a stark representation of 
        the difference in danger for various users of Chicago's streets. It did exactly what I hoped: acknowledged the massive number of 
        car-on-car crashes, in juxtaposition with the far greater severity of car-on-person accidents. The rings were a space efficient 
        proportion visualization that centered the viewer on each street's story without the bloat that 6 bar charts would have required 
        to relay that in the same way. The map was both the crown jewel and greatest missed opportunity. Had I been able to collect and 
        make use of bike lane data, I could have shown all the same information with the added dimension of how it intersects with the 
        infrastructure we have in place. That said, I am very happy with the heatmapping effect that the map provides, as well as the 
        striking discomfort in realizing that every single dot is a human being struck by several tons of speeding metal.
